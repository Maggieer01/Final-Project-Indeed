We’re building the next generation of dev tools to support teams in building and running apps on Kubernetes. This is a new category of tooling called “Internal Developer Platforms”. Pioneered for some time in companies such as Spotify, Github, Airbnb, and others we are providing the fastest way for teams to build their own Internal Developer Platforms. Internal Developer Platforms provide a developer experience as simple as Heroku but on top of the tech and tools the team uses already.
